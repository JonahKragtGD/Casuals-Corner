            <p class="p-left">Helldivers II is my most played game on steam. There’s good reason for that. Between playing it solo and playing with friends its been my go to when I want some shooter action that isn’t being ruined by people who play the game 24/7. It’s a perfect casual drop in drop out co op shooter that allows you to approach objectives your own way with a plethora of weapons and stratagems at your disposal. Helldivers II originally launched back in February of 2024 and at time of writing has been out for well over a year. I bought it on launch after seeing all the hype videos people were sharing all over social media. All the FOR DEMOCRACY shouts, crazy explosions, and your character flying across the screen for maximum Looney Toons style unintentional comedy and I had to dive for myself. </p>

        <h1>Any issues?</h1>
        <div class="sample">
            <p class="p-left">It wasn’t always a smooth ride for Helldivers II however, heck right from the get go it suffered long queue times since their servers were at capacity, the whole PSN ID fiasco, and then just a lack of worth while updates to get people back to playing. Despite all this, Helldivers II had taken over the “idle” game title for me. Now since this is the first time I have mentioned what my “idle” game is, let me explain. For me what I call my “idle” game is whatever I play when I can’t think of anything else to do, chores are done, errands ran, personal projects worked on, gym hit. It’s what I sit down to play when I have anywhere from ten minutes to a couple hours to kill. For years it was any game in the Halo series, Battlefield games, or the COD franchise. And these games still are my “idle” games from time to time. However Helldivers II has firmly carved out itself a nice role in my “idle” games rotation. Since its release I have logged over 200 hours in the game. Most of that time coming from playing missions here or there solo. I would log on, select a mission somewhere between 4-7 difficulty, and then get right to it. It’s the perfect game for playing something at your own pace since you can choose to go straight to the objectives and get out without doing any of the extras. On the other side of this, each mission has a time limit, most standard missions have a 40 minute time limit and others have 12 or 15 minute time limits respectively. What makes these shorter ones great is that they often turn into “okay guys we can do one more short one” and that’s when you know a game has you in a choke hold.</p>

                <h1>So what?</h1>
        <div class="sample">
            <p class="p-right">Even with some stumbles here and there Helldivers II has made leaps and bounds in it’s content offerings since the beginning. They’ve added tons of new weapons, stratagems, locations, objectives, customization options, and they’ve even launching on Xbox here in about a week at time of writing (Helldivers II launches on Xbox Series S/X on  August 26th), with that comes their first Legendary Warbond. Since that lines up with the Xbox release the devs were able to secure a Halo 3 ODST crossover for the first Legendary Warbond. With it comes 4 more weapons from the Halo universe and even more customization options for players. It’s important to talk about the Halo ODST Warbond as this is not the first crossover Helldivers has done, that honor belongs to Killzone. The reason it’s worth bringing up is the fact they botched the first crossover, originally, the Killzone items were only available in the Super Store for a short period of time and for a crazy amount of Super Credits. But thankfully the devs took feedback after community outrage and rectified the situation by giving players some of the items for free. It’s nice to know that Arrowhead, the devs of Helldivers II are listening to the community. Because of this I may even go so far as to say Helldivers II may be the best live service game of all time. But that’s a Cold Take for another day.</p>

                <h1>What's next?</h1>
        <div class="sample">
            <p class="p-left">In the meantime, I will keep dropping in to the many planets and systems of Helldivers II with or without friends. As long as they keep bringing stuff to the table, I see myself playing this game for a very very long time. Thank you for taking the time to read this article! If you’d like to read more there are plenty of other articles available in each of the Hot Takes, Cold Takes, and Playing categories. Enjoy!</p>
