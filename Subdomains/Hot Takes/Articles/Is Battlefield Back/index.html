            <p class="p-left">Are we back? Knee jerk reaction, first two games down Jonah seems to think so. It’s been a bumpy ride for the Battlefield franchise over the last 8 years or so. With indie and AA games like Battlebit, Isonzo, Holdfast, etc. coming out to get a slice of the Battlefield pie. Before now it seemed like Battlefield was dead in the water, especially after the horrible fiasco that was Battlefield 2042. Now I know this is the earliest of the earliest takes we can get here, at the time of writing it’s the first day of the open beta for Battlefield 6, I barely know how it works, and I have not kept up with much of the pre release hype. A couple buddies of mine who are more in tune with all things Battlefield have keyed me in, and for that I am grateful. With the beta being free, why not dive in if you can? It runs from August 9th-10th and then the following weekend August 14th-17th. One note I will mention is what you need to do in order to play the game on PC. EA has decided to try and tackle cheating by requiring secure boot to launch the game. For this, you need to go into your BIOS settings and change it. A little annoying, and can take some time to figure out if you don’t already know how to do it. But thankfully if you play on console you don’t have to deal with it.</p>

        <h1>What's Changed?</h1>
        <div class="sample">
            <p class="p-left">First and foremost BF6 has returned to class based gameplay, BF2042 had specialists, they were clearly trying to cash in on the whole hero shooter craze. IMO a Battlefield game with distinct roles and distinct classes is what works best as it makes teamwork easier and more accessible. One thing I wasn’t a huge fan of right off the bat is the fact any class can use any weapon. I think that is a little weird, but I am willing to play more and have my opinion changed on this matter once the full game releases and I get a better grasp on the ebb and flow of BF6 and it’s weapons. The beta does offer a weapon lock mode that restricts which weapons each class can use. Another thing I am looking forward to is the return of a campaign in Battlefield. BF1 and BFV both had war stories, which IDK if it’s a hot take or not, but I loved them. They were great bite sized campaigns that you could easily finish in one setting. Perfect for a filthy casual like me. BF6 is gonna have a full on single player campaign. From what I’ve read about it, I’m sure I’ll play it and get a nice 4-6 hours out of it. BF6 will also feature a Battle Royale mode. I am not the biggest BR guy, but I am sure I will play a match or two, last time Battlefield did a proper BR mode was BFV Firestorm, which I played exactly one and only one match in it’s entire lifespan. Another fun change the Battlefield team took from Battlebit was the drag and revive feature, which if you’re like me and you like to run into the fray and ask questions later it will probably save your bacon a few times.</p>

        <h1>Are We Back?</h1>
        <div class="sample">
            <p class="p-left">For now the BF6 beta has me feeling good, for almost all of my gamer life I have switched between COD, Halo, and Battlefield to get my multiplayer FPS kicks. I like having multiple games to play in case I get mad playing one and want to switch to another, or if a game starts to drop off in player base. A fun and successful Battlefield game will only be a good thing for FPS games as a whole, a little competition in the AAA FPS space is a good thing, although I have been extremely happy with the indie and AA FPS space as of late, between boomer shooters and games like Battlebit and Isonzo, there is always SOMETHING to play, but if you want full, consistent lobbies, a new Battlefield game should fill that gap. I will be playing the BF6 beta all weekend, and most likely next weekend too. The full release is scheduled for Oct 10th and how I feel at the end of these two weekends will dictate if this is a day one or wait for sale purchase. Thank you for reading, keep it casual!</p>
